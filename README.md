## Deployment

Camberley Karting is deployed using Heroku

<details>
<summary>Heroku Deployment steps: </summary>

 1. Ensure all dependencies are listed within the requirements.txt file

 Within the terminal in Gitpod type `pip3 --local freeze > requirements.txt`, and a list with all requirements will be created to be read by Heroku.

 2. Setting up Heroku

- NB Due to security issues connecting github directly to heroku (at the time this project was deployed),
    first you must log into your heroku account via the terminal in gitpod (more info on this further down).

    2.1 Next, navigate to the [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) website

    2.2 Login to Heroku

    2.3 Click on `New` (top right) and Create a new app

    2.4 Choose a project name and set your location

    2.5. Navigate to the `Resources` tab

    2.6. In the `Add ons` section, search for Heroku Postgres and select it on the list
  - A pop up will appear, select, 'Hobby Dev' and click `Submit order form`

    2.7.1. Next, You would usually navigate to the `deploy` tab;
  - Click on connect to Github
  - Search for the repository named Camberley Karting
  - And connect heroku to Github.
    2.7.2. But, as mentioned above this is not possible for the time being.
  - So instead, In order to connect gitpod to heroku type:
    - `$ heroku login -i`
    - Then enter your heroku credentials,
    - Now you are logged into heroku in Gitpod
    - Once all code is commited and pushed to Github, simply push code from Gitpod to heroku using the command:
    - Heroku will start the build process, this can be viewed under the `Activity` tab
    - Once the build process has completed, navigate to `Open App`
    - The app should now be ready to view

    2.8. Navigate to the settings tab

    2.9.  Click on Config Vars, and add Cloudinary, Database URL (from Heroku-Postgres) and Secret key

<summary>Forking the GitHub Repository </summary>

- By forking the GitHub Repository, you will be able to make a copy of the original repository on your own GitHub account, allowing you to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:

  - Log in to your own GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository you wish to fork
  - At the top of the Repository (not top of page), just above the "Settings" button on the menu, locate the "Fork" button.
  - You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account

- Making a Local Clone

  - Log in to your own GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
  - Under the repository name, click "Clone or download"
  - To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link
  - Open Git Bash
  - Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made
  - Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3

 $ git clone <https://github.com/jamieroche1987/Camberley-Karting>

Press Enter. Your local clone will be created
